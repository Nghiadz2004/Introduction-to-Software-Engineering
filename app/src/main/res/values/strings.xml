    <string name="bdBookSummary">Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four,
        Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and
        uncle. Then, on Harry\'s eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some
        astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure
        is about to begin! J.K. Rowling\'s internationally bestselling Harry Potter books continue to captivate new generations of readers.
        Harry's first adventure alongside his friends, Ron and Hermione, will whisk you away to Hogwarts, an enchanted, turreted castle
        filled with disappearing staircases, pearly-white ghosts and magical paintings that flit from frame to frame. This gorgeous paperback
        edition features a spectacular cover by award-winning artist Jonny Duddle, as well as refreshed bonus material including fun facts
        exploring the origins of names such as Albus Dumbledore, Hedwig and other favourite characters. This is the perfect starting point
        for anyone who's ready to lose themselves in the biggest children's books of all time.</string>
